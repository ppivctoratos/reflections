What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	--When you initialize a repository it creates a git folder that is invisible to the user. This git data is used when referring to the files in the directory. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	--The staging area "readies up" what files you want to push into a commit. This gives the user kind of a scratch pad to work on before verifying a commit. This way the commit is logical.
